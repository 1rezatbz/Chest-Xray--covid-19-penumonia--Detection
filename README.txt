To run the notebook use jupyter note book and replace the base_directory
variable with a string representation of the directory of the folder containing the
train and test data folder as shown in the note notebook

Google colab with GPU can also be used for this
Just upload the data folder into the drive and change the base_directory
variable according to the above.

There verbose is set to 2 and when training starts it might appear that nothing is happening but the training takes place in the background.
